# EventSky : AI driven trip planning app
EventSky is a mobile app that improves long-term weather planning by using decades of historical climate data, including NASA POWER and GPM datasets, to estimate the probability of extreme conditions like heat, cold, rainfall, or strong winds. Users can select a location and date, and the app calculates averages, extremes, and exceedance probabilities, presenting results with clear visualizations such as probability bars, distribution plots, and interactive maps. EventSky also allows data downloads in CSV or JSON with metadata and direct NASA links, helping individuals and organizers make informed decisions and manage weather-related risks.
# Problem Statement
Planning outdoor activities and events is often disrupted by unpredictable extreme weather, and conventional long-term forecasts are limited in accuracy and scope. Individuals, organizers, and communities lack accessible tools that leverage historical climate records and advanced datasets to assess the probability of heat, cold, rainfall, strong winds, or general discomfort for a specific location and date. This gap makes it difficult to make informed decisions, manage weather-related risks, and understand potential impacts of climate variability and change.

# Introduction
**EventSky** is a mobile application that goes beyond conventional long-term forecasts by leveraging decades of historical climate records and reanalysis datasets, including NASA POWER and GPM to estimate the probability of extreme weather conditions such as heat, cold, rainfall, strong winds, or general discomfort. Users can select a location by entering a place name or dropping a pin on a map, then choose a specific date or month. The system retrieves relevant datasets, calculates averages and extremes, and estimates exceedance probabilities, presenting the results through clear and engaging visualizations such as probability bars, distribution plots, and interactive maps. Additionally, EventSky allows users to download data in CSV or JSON formats, complete with metadata and direct links to NASA data sources. By transforming complex Earth observation data into accessible, actionable insights, EventSky empowers individuals, event organizers, and communities to plan outdoor activities, manage weather-related risks, and better understand the potential impacts of climate variability and change.
